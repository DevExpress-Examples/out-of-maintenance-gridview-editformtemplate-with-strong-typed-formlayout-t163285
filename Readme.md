# GridView - EditFormTemplate with strong-typed FormLayout


<p>You can find how to place a FormLayout inside the EditForm template in the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T102593">A simple implementation of FormLayout inside EditFormTemplate</a> example (which does not use the FormLayout strong-typed feature). The advantages of the strong-typed approach:<br /><br />1. The built-in client-side Unobtrusive validation;<br /><br />2. If you change the name of a model property, you will easily find places where you need to change that name as well when compiling your project.<br /><br />The main idea of this example is to create a separate partial view with a FormLayout. Since the grid requires a model that represents a list of data items, but to be strong-typed, a FormLayout should be bound to a single item, this approach will allow us to use a strong-typed model in the partial view with a FormLayout and pass a particular item from the Grid partial view to the FormLayout partial view.<br /><br />Take a note at how the "Update" and "Cancel" button client-side clicks are handled:</p>


```cs
btnSettings.ClientSideEvents.Click = string.Format("function(s, e) {{ {0}.UpdateEdit(); }}", settings.Name);

```


<p> </p>


```vb
btnSettings.ClientSideEvents.Click = String.Format("function(s, e) {{ {0}.UpdateEdit(); }}", settings.Name)
```


<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, instead of a hard-coded grid view extension name, the settings.Name property is used. This will ensure that the corresponding client-side methods will be precisely executed for our grid view extension.</p>
